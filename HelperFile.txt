Domain - core of the business problems
subdomian - specific aspect of the larger domain
ubiquitous language

DDD
Layred architure

2. Application layer - coradinate business operation but doesn't im[lement business logic
3. Infrasture layer - techincal details - database acess or the message queque
4. User interface layer- interacting with end-user or extrnal system

Strageic Design(Bounded context , context map)

Big Ball of mud problem

context - a specific domain or subdomian that has a bounded context
bounded  context -  boundary that defines a specific domain/subdomain in which terms and concepts have a specific menaing
relatationship - symmetric or asymmetric
1.Partnership
2. Shared Kernel - sahre domain model or data source
3. Customer suppliers - one context provide the fucntionality or data to anoother context, whihc will consume
4. confomist
5. anti corruption layer
6. open host services
7. publisehed languge
8. sperate ways


C4 model

Tatical Design ---
- Entites(identity, lifecycle, mutable state) - changeable object
-Value concetps or values that doesn't ahve entity
-Aggregates - aggreagte root
